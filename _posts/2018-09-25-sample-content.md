Let's imagine this is a great article you really made an effort to write. It's well written, it's appropiately lengthy, and it has meaningful content.

And this is the part you sligthly introduce the importance of what you're writing. Oh! Did I mention that **7 of every 10 people represent 70% of that people**? Well, I did now.

I think some people refer to this part as justification. Try to convince people your article worths a read.

## Content

* TOC
{:toc}

## I'm Thrór

But you can call me H2 header. 

### I'm Thráin, Son of Thrór

But you can call me H3 header.

#### I'm Thorin, Son of Thráin, Son of Thrór

This is H4, you get the point.

## Some elements

### Text

`Hey! In Markdown you can easily add **bold**, or *italic* text modifiers ~~or whatever they are called~~.`

Hey! In Markdown you can easily add **bold**, or *italic* text modifiers ~~or whatever they are called~~.

`You can ~~*even* **mix** ***them***~~`

You can ~~*even* **mix** ***them***~~

If you want to divide some text by some reason, you can do it with a rule: `---`

That gives the impression that the two paragraphs are related, but just sligthly. Doesn't it?

#### Citing

So you say you know how to cite external texts? Great! Look at me! I'm a flagrant act of copyright infrigment![^Hercules]

### Tables

Tables can be generated easilly with [Markdown Table Generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables){:target="_blank"}.

| Satellite              	| Suburb                   	|
|------------------------	|--------------------------	|
| Consumes labor         	| Consumes products        	|
| Supplies products      	| Supplies labor           	|
| Usually larger in size 	| Usually larger in number 	|

A suburb is a *relatively small* and structured community. It is adjacent to, and depended upon a large central city.

The two defining characteristics that provide the *suburban* status are:

- **Ecological position**
    - Further than urban neighborhood. Closer than rural neighborhood.
    - Remain dependent of central city as source of goods and services.
- **Commuting**
    - Are adjacent to urban centers, but provide jobs for their own and close residents.

When a city is just born, it'll, most of the times, have one small city center in which all economic activities take place.

As the city grows, various activities start to take place outside the core. That's the first threshold. The one that marks the appearance of roads, as some communication between periphery and center is needed.

Once a road appear between suburb `S[0]` and city center `C`, the commuting time decreases, allowing more people to live in `S[0]`.

When enough people lives in `S[0]`, economic activities start to appear around. 

If you repeat the proccess to suburbs `S[1]`, `S[2]` ... `S[n]` you start to have multiple activity clusters other than the city center. **Activity clusters that need connections between them**.

And that necessity can only be satisfied with the building of secondary roads.
